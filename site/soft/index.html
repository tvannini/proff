 0.<b> ~ Preamble ~
</b>
    This project was born from the problem of writing clear, consistent,
    good-looking, web-able documentation.

    After working for a while with LATEX, *roff, WYSIWYG  editors,  HTML
    and WIKICode, I came up with a brand new solution: I just wanted  to
    definitively wipe tags out.

    PRoff, my Personal Roff, is the result  of  my  effort  and  I  hope
    someone will find it useful.  If  you  have  ideas,  suggestions  or
    questions please mail to <a href="mailto:tvannini@gmail.com">tvannini@gmail.com</a>.

 2.<b> ~ How PRoff works ~
</b>
    The idea is to identify a set of criteria to beautify a  text,  with
    no need of tags or other text-extraneous elements.

    One only rule:<b> ~ feeding a processed document as a  source,  process
    must result in the same document ~.</b>

    This document, for example, as you see it, is  the  source  and  the
    result at the same time.

    See PRoff at work:
     &lt;<a href="http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/sample.html">http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/sample.html</a>&gt;

    Sample will compare a raw text file:
     &lt;<a href="http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/lorem-raw.txt">http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/lorem-raw.txt</a>&gt;
    with 3 different formatting stages of the same file:
     . PRoffed: &lt;<a href="http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/lorem-proffed.txt">http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/lorem-proffed.txt</a>&gt;
     . Soft: &lt;<a href="http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/soft/lorem.html">http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/soft/lorem.html</a>&gt;
     . Full: &lt;<a href="http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/full/lorem.html">http://tvannini.github.io/proff/site/full/lorem.html</a>&gt;


 3.<b> ~ Formatting syntax ~
</b>
    Document text can be written considering a few tricks that will help
    PRoff to respect and rightly understand your document style.

    Here for &quot;graphic&quot; element is intended  a  character  (or  block  of
    characters) matching regular expression &quot;\W+&quot;.

     - All in-paragraph multiple spaces will be reduced to one.
     - Line breaks will not break paragraphs.
     - All paragraphs larger than line width will be justified.
     - Blank lines will be respected and they break paragraphs.
     - Start each unordered list element with a &quot;graphic&quot; char or  block
       and sibling space(s), then indent next lines.
     - Start each ordered list element with a number, a optional sibling
       &quot;graphic&quot; char or block and space(s), then indent next lines.
     - All indentation changes, not recognized as un/ordered lists, will
       cause a line break. - In  other  words:  with  the  exception  of
       un/ordered lists elements first line, all  rows  of  a  paragraph
       will have the same source indentation.
     - Lines starting with a &quot;&gt;&quot; will not be processed and they will  be
       added to text as they are.
     - All text bounded by a &quot;~&quot; will be displayed as black in soft  and
       full HTML rendering
     - Text  surrounded  on  4  sides  by  &quot;graphic&quot;  elements  will  be
       displayed as bordered in full HTML rendering.
