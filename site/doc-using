 4. ~ How to use PRoff ~

    PRoff is a batch program: it runs without any user interaction. It
    can produce files or send text on STDOUT, recoverable by pipes.

    Tipically it can be run from command line or from within another
    program like a text editor.

    When PRoff starts it will look for configuration file. Default
    configuration file is proff.ini, in the same directory as PRoff
    executable or script. Command line passed parameters will override
    INI directives.


    4.1. ~ From command line ~

         You can run PRoff both as PHP script and as WIN executable. In
         order to run it as PHP script, you need a PHP working
         installation.

         WIN executable - Command line:
          proff.exe <source> [<option> [<value>] ...]

         PHP script - Command line:
          php.exe proff.php <source> [<option> [<value>] ...]

         Where:

            <source>

               Source text file to format.

            <option> <value>

               One or more of the following options and values:

               -h Displays help informations (no <value> is needed).

               -i Configuration file. Set <value> to INI file to use.

               -r Result file. If a valid file name is passed as
                  <value>, result text will be written to file, else
                  result text will be output to STDOUT. If no full path
                  is provided for <result_file>, processed file position
                  will be determinated starting from source file
                  directory.

               -w Page width. Set <value> to number of characters
                  (columns) to justify text to (default is 72).

               -p Markup (production type). Passed <value> can be one of
                  following values:

                   [0|FALSE]...... Text is formatted without markup
                   [1|TRUE|SOFT].. Text is formatted with soft markup
                   [FULL]......... Text is formatted with full markup
                                   (default value is FALSE).

               -o Open result file (no <value> is needed).

               -m Send as mail (no <value> is needed).

         Options -r, -w, -p, -o, -m and many more ones can be set by
         configuration file directives. See proff.ini file for a
         complete configuration directives description.

         The easiest way to use PRoff is to prepare one or more
         configuration files containing all needed parameters. With
         PRoff package are provided three configuration files (text.ini,
         soft.ini, full.ini) that can be used to make, respectively,
         text, soft HTML and full HTML processing.

         To use one of the provided configuration files just run
          path/to/proff.exe -i full.ini
         from command line.

         Configuration file proff.ini is the default one, used when no
         other file is passed: it contains all detailed directives and
         it can be used to start creating new configuration files.


    4.2. ~ From text editor ~

         PRoff can be easily integrated in most text editors, just
         setting an external program execution and passing ambient
         variables to PRoff executable.

         For example, for integrating PRoff in Notepad++ text editor
         (<http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm>) just add
         following lines to file notepad++/shortcuts.xml configuration
         file:

>           <UserDefinedCommands>
>              <Command name="Format as text"
>                       Ctrl="yes"
>                       Alt="yes"
>                       Shift="no"
>                       Key="84">
>               path/to/proff.exe "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" -i text.ini -o
>              </Command>
>              <Command name="Format as HTML"
>                       Ctrl="yes"
>                       Alt="yes"
>                       Shift="no"
>                       Key="72">
>               path/to/proff.exe "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" -i soft.ini -o
>              </Command>
>              <Command name="Format as full HTML"
>                       Ctrl="yes"
>                       Alt="yes"
>                       Shift="no"
>                       Key="88">
>               path/to/proff.exe "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" -i full.ini -o
>              </Command>
>           </UserDefinedCommands>

         Now it will be possible, from within Notepad++, calling PRoff
         directly, pressing CTRL+ALT+T (for text format), CTRL+ALT+H
         (for soft HTML format) and CTRL+ALT+X (for full HTML format).


         ~ SublimeText plugin ~

         PRoff is also a plugin for SublimeText editor, both versions 2
         and 3.

         See PRoff-SublimeText-plugin section for more informations.


         ~ External Edit ~

         Once you have PRoff running on you preferred text editor you
         can intergate it with all system text-areas by "external-edit"
         script.
