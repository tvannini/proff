 3. ~ Script description ~

    The script works in two steps: file text is passed to a
    "pre-processor" that transforms it into an array; then the array is
    passed to a "post-processor" that composes final text from it.


    3.1. ~ Pre-processor ~

         First script, pre-processor, splits text into an array of
         paragraphs and returns each paragraph indentation and first
         line indentation. The script respects blank lines, un/ordered
         lists and graphical elements.


    3.2. ~ Post-processor ~

         Post-processor script formats each paragraph according with
         indentation, first line indentation and global width and it
         composes final text.

          If marking up is requested post-processor runs some extra
          regular expression to:
           - make href links from URLs
           - make mailto links from email addresses
           - mark as bold double-intensity text (~text~)

          HTML rendering is offered in two flavours: "soft" or "full".
          If soft one is requested text is returned in <pre> tags for
          preserving mono-spaced format in HTML.

          Full one, instead, returns document divided into paragraphs
          (<p>) with indentation and first line indentation style
          properties. Graphic surrounded text will be rendered as framed
          and double
         intensity characters ("~") will be stripped out from black
         text.
