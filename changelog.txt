 ~ PRoff ChangeLog ~


 ~ 1.03 ~

   - Fixed bug: processed file misses last row.
   - Fixed bug: cursor reposition while editing.
   - Removed double quotes replacement.
   - Changed emphasis character to "~".


 ~ 1.02 ~

   - Changed command line parameters system from positional to nominal.
   - Parameters management in file INI. Default proff.ini used if no INI
     file is passed as parameter.
   - Added directory management to work with relative paths. Script will
     look for INI files  starting  from  PRoff  directory  and  it  will
     determine  processed  file  location  starting  from  source   file
     directory.
   - Added "open result" feature: after process, result file  is  passed
     to the operating system and opened with the default  program.  Open
     result can be set by INI directive "show = on" or by  command  line
     parameter "-o".
   - Added "send as mail" capabilities: -m from command line and  [mail]
     section in INI file.
   - Added many  HTML  rendering  directives:  document,  area,  prefix,
     suffix, text, frame, a, ahover.


 ~ 1.01 ~

   - Added "cite" paragraphs: each first line starts with ">".
   - Added double quotes substitution with left/right quotes.
   - Improved full HTML format.
